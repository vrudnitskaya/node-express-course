1. Quickly explain how middleware is used in an Express application.

Middleware functions have access to the request object (req), response object (res), and the next middleware function (next()) in the application's request-response cycle. 
Middleware helps speed up applications, avoid API dependency, and reduce development costs.


2. What does CRUD stand for?

CRUD - Create, Read, Update, and Delete - are basic actions you can do with data in a database.

3. You are careful to store your sensitive information in a .env file.
3.1. How do you get your app to access the information in the .env file?

To use sensitive information from a .env file in your application, you will need the dotenv package.

3.2. How do you protect the contents of the .env file so that it is not stored in your Github repository?

To keep the information in the .env file safe, you need to add the .env to a file called .gitignore. This way, the file won't be pushed to Github, where anyone could get your sensitive information.
